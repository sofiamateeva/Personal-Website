        <p>When I was little, I moved to Spain with my mother. We lived in Madrid for over a year and I even attended kindergarden there. I had time to learn a decent amount of Spanish and made some great friends. Unfortunatelly, I was to young back then, so I do not remember much of the city itself. However, I plan on visiting Madrid again this year, so I'll keep you posted! </p>

        <p> Five summers ago, back in 2015, I went to Shanghai in order to attend an international youth camp along with participants from over 20 other countries. On the very first day all 150 of us were divided into teams of ten and our goal was to solve different tasks as a group. All challenges were extremely interesting and I made some life-long friends. My favorite task was navigating through the center of Shanghai as a group. We also got a chance to delve into the culture of the country and visit some of its most famous monuments.</p>

        <p> It is the first of January. I'm relaxing by the pool and sipping a coctail. I spent the last ten days here in Bali, and I'm absolutely in love! You can go for a walk in the jungle, relax on a beautiful beach, or visit one of the thousands of temples. Also, everyone here is so nice! The place is just magical. I wish I could stay here forever!
