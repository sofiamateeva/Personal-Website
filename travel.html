        <h2> Places to visit</h2>
        
        <body> Bali is one of the most evocative and popular tourist islands of the entire Indonesian archipelago. A visit here sparks the senses. As soon as you arrive, the intoxicating fragrance of incense and clove oil hangs in the thick tropical air. Peanuts sizzle at roadside stalls, petal-strewn offerings smolder on busy sidewalks, and traditional gamelan music jangles against the buzz of mopeds. Despite the clamor and chaos of the main tourist areas, the island is rich in natural beauty, with attractions for every kind of traveler. Surfers come for the legendary swells, hikers can trek up jungly volcanic peaks and to misty waterfalls, and cyclists can bike through lush landscapes bristling with rice terraces and traditional villages. The island's rich arts scene is another top draw, and if relaxation is your top priority, the shopping in Bali and spa treatments are fabulous - and affordable. Spirituality adds yet another layer to Bali's allure, and seeing the magnificent temples and sacred Hindu ceremonies are top things to do. Since the famous book and film Eat, Pray, Love spotlighted Bali, the tourist throngs have undeniably swelled, but you can still experience old Bali if you stray off the beaten track.</body>

        <h2> Traditional Food </h2>
        
        <body>Balinese food gets me excited every time we come back to Indonesia’s most popular holiday spot. I get excited about unpretentious flavours and time-tested spices that result in mouth-watering food that I just can’t get enough of.

While other Southeast Asian cuisines may offer a similar selection of dishes, many foods in Bali have a unique twist with tantalising flavours. <br>
You should try at least some of these:

<ul>
    <li> Pisang Goreng </li>
    <li> Mie Goreng </li>
    <li> Sate </li>
</ul>
